Basically, this paper is about norm and behaviors.
We studied KMNS: Kenya 2008/9, Mali 2006 cf{the report was in French}, and Nigeria 2008 and Senegal 2005.

Research Questions:

+ The main research question is what the associations are among women's beliefs in FGC benefits, their position on whether to continue FGC practice in the future, and whether to cut their daughters.
+ Secondary questio:  to investigate the associations of women’s gender awareness, and their beliefs of FGC benefits.  It is presumed that gender awareness interrelate to FGC beliefs.  By testing the relations of the two factors allows us to gather information for a better interpretation of the main model.

variables:
+ In the main model, the predictors are women’s FGC status and FGC benefits  (see the list of FGC benefits at table--) and the response variables are women’s opinion on whether the practice of FGC, and whether to cut their daughters.  In the secondary model, women’s gender awareness is the predictor and beliefs of FGC benefits the response.
+ other covariates:  country \cf{We don’t need this if we analyze each country separately}, age, education, wealth, ethnicity, religion, marital status, work status, residence (urban vs. rural), media use (another PCA or score?) and gender awareness.
+ covariates at a community level:  education, wealth, media use, FGC benefits, gender awareness and FGC prevalence

other issues and questions:
+ to decide if to include the following avriable at the community level:  wealth, education and media use
+ To confirm:  att (gender awareness: no=0, DK=1 and yes=2):  the higher the score is, the LESS aware of gender equality a woman feels.  FGC bene (no=0, yes=1):  the higher the score, the stronger in believing FGC beneifts.  Media use (not at all=0..., almost everyday=3):  the higher the score, the more in using media.
+ There is a problem with the big model.  Originally, we wanted to include all the women (with daughters to FGC or not) for their opinion in future FGC practice.  They seemed to be dropped out in the big model, right?
+ How about our secondary question?
+ studying threshold/tipping point: to test if when FGC prevalence reaches certain point , the behaviors start to change (either direction), and if the association of benefit and prevalence also play a crucial role in the "tipping point"?


decision:
+ This study is about testing hypothesis not prediction.
+ We agree on using spline for age and wealth keep more power (correct?)
+ Cluster is treated as the only random effect; while ethinicity and religion are fixed.
+ We used score (instead of PCA) to represent Media use, FGC benefits, gender awareness.
