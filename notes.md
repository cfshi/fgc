Basically, this paper is about norm and behaviors.
We studied KMNS: Kenya 2008/9, Mali 2006 cf{the report was in French}, and Nigeria 2008 and Senegal 2005.

+ Research Questions:

The main research question is what the associations are among women's beliefs in FGC benefits, their position on whether to continue FGC practice in the future, and whether to cut their daughters.  

Secondary questio:  to investigate the associations of women’s gender awareness, and their beliefs of FGC benefits.  It is presumed that gender awareness interrelate to FGC beliefs.  By testing the relations of the two factors allows us to gather information for a better interpretation of the main model.

variables:
+ In the main model, the predictors are women’s FGC status and FGC benefits  (see the list of FGC benefits at table--) and the response variables are women’s opinion on whether the practice of FGC, and whether to cut their daughters.  In the secondary model, women’s gender awareness is the predictor and beliefs of FGC benefits the response.
+ other covariates:  country \cf{We don’t need this if we analyze each country separately}, age, education, wealth, ethnicity, religion, marital status, work status, residence (urban vs. rural), media use (another PCA or score?) and gender awareness.
+ covariates at a community level:  education, wealth, media use, FGC benefits, gender awareness and FGC prevalence

other issues:
+ PCA or scores for media use, FGC benefits, gender awareness.
+ Cluster is treated as WHAT effect?
+ Is ethinicty a random or fixed variable? jd{Ideally, we would make ethnicity a random effect, but we are back to the Gilmour problem I guess.}


decision:
+ Chyun still has no clear ideas whether to make these modles FIT or PREDICTION?  Jonathan made the decision:  it is a hypothesis testing not to predict.
+ Do we spline weath and age?  Yes.  We reached an agreement on using spline which compared to categorical variables keep more power (correct?)
