Basically, this paper is about norm and behaviors.
We studied KMNS: Kenya 2008/9, Mali 2006 (C: the report was in French), Nigeria 2008 and Sierra Leone 2008.

Research Questions:

+ The main research question (all multivariate) is what the associations are among women's beliefs in FGC benefits, their position on whether to continue FGC practice in the future, and whether to cut their daughters. (only women with daughter to be cut are included)
+ The secondary question (all future fgc):  what the associations are among women's beliefs in FGC benefits and their position on whether to continue FGC practice in the future (all the women are included)
+ Third question:  daughter vs. whether to continue (only women with daughter included) (We migh need it.  This is a model we hope can provide more details to explain the first question).
+ We are going to run versions of our two main models, but without group level covariates.


Variables:
+ In the main model, the predictors are women’s FGC status and FGC benefits  (see the list of FGC benefits at table--) and the response variables are women’s opinion on whether the practice of FGC, and whether to cut their daughters.  In the secondary model, women’s gender awareness is the predictor and beliefs of FGC benefits the response.
+ other covariates:  country \cf{We don’t need this if we analyze each country separately}, age, education, wealth, ethnicity, religion, marital status, work status, residence (urban vs. rural), media use (another PCA or score?) and gender awareness.
+ covariates at a community level:  education, wealth, media use, FGC benefits, gender awareness and FGC prevalence

Other issues and questions:
+ to think about the fourth question?
+ studying threshold/tipping point: to test if when FGC prevalence reaches certain point , the behaviors start to change (either direction), and if the association of benefit and prevalence also play a crucial role in the "tipping point"?
+ Efferson etc's paper (15):  What can it tell us about heterogeniety ("a singel critical threshold is unlikely to exist"). They argued that FGC is not a socially conditined norm.  Will our findings support or rebut it?
+ to investigate the associations of women’s gender awareness, and their beliefs of FGC benefits.  It is presumed that gender awareness interrelate to FGC beliefs.  By testing the relations of the two factors allows us to gather information for a better interpretation of the main model. (which group of women?  with or withtout daughers to be cut?)
+ to study contrast of countries.

Background:
+ att (gender awareness: no=0, DK=1 and yes=2):  the higher the score is, the LESS aware of gender equality a woman feels.  FGC bene (no=0, yes=1):  the higher the score, the stronger in believing FGC beneifts.  Media use (not at all=0..., almost everyday=3):  the higher the score, the more in using media.
+ media scores from 0-3 (3 questions), att 0-2 (5 questions), bene 0-2 (9 questions).

Decisions:
+ This study is about testing hypothesis not prediction.
+ We agree on using spline for age and wealth (to keep more power, correct?)
+ Cluster is treated as the only random effect; while ethinicity and religion are fixed.
+ We used score (instead of PCA) to represent Media use, FGC benefits, gender awareness.
+ to include wealth, and education at the community level.
+ to make ethnicity a random because we don't need the power for the result.  We have enough levels for our reason; and we are not particularly interested in ethnicity for our study.  BUT we latter decided to put it back as a fixed variable.
+ We decided to run versionso our two main models, but without group level covariates. (Apr 20, 15)
