We will try to build a multi-level, multivariate-response model:

women's FGC status; FGC belief 
	--> overall FGC future; daughter's future FGC status

We are starting with four data sets (ke5, ng5, ml5, sl5).

Our next step is to look at PCA analyses of responses about FGC benefit.

We might look into logistic PCA

We will build the univariate response model first with using clmm2 clusterid as random effect 

Done. now try to do the bolker MANOVA trick. (Is that what we are going to call it from now on?)
