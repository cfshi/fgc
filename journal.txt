We will try to build a multi-level, multivariate-response model:

women's FGC status; FGC belief 
	--> overall FGC future; daughter's future FGC status

We are starting with four data sets (ke5, ng5, ml5, sl5).

Our next step is to look at PCA analyses of responses about FGC benefit.

We might look into logistic PCA
