*** The main question:  to include 2 predictors (mother's FGC status and their beliefs of FGC benefits) and two levels (individual and community levels) of the outcome variable (overall FGC future, and daughters' FGC future status) in a multilevel model (hierachical model).***  Is this right?

There are 3 models:

M1:  women's FGC status and FGC belief  --> overall FGC future

M2:  women's FGC status and FGC belief --> daughter's future FGC status

M3:  correlation of women's FGC belief, overall FGC future and daughter's future FGC status

We want to combine _all_ of these into a big multivariate-response model,

Big: women's FGC status; FGC belief 
	--> overall FGC future; daughter's future FGC status
