# fgc

*** The main question:  to include 2 predictors (mother's FGC status and their beliefs of FGC benefits) and two levels (individual and community levels) of the outcome variable (overall FGC future, and daughters' FGC future status) in a multilevel model (hierachical model).***  

We want to combine _all_ of these into a big multivariate-response model,

Big: women's FGC status; FGC belief 
	--> overall FGC future; daughter's future FGC status

+ For the data:
ng5:  there are almost 54% of women never heard of fgc; it means that more than half of the samples are NAs.  To mention in the manuscript.

+ We also like to use men's beliefs of FGC benefits in the future (e.g., Mali)

+ a possible longitudinal project for the 4 nations.
